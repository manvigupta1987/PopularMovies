## Popular Movies App:

This is the first project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to built an app which helps in discovering the popular movies and top rated movies. It also displays the detail of each movie like title, overview, average voting etc. This app utilizes core Android user interface components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.


### Getting Started

App uses The Movie Database API. You have to enter your API key in order to run the app. You can create your own one very easy! https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup?language=en-EN. When you get it, just set it here: "MovieAppStage1/gradle.properties"
MyMovieDbApiKey = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
